Teamtreehouse - Project 8<br />
SQL Library Manager

I built this dynamic web app that demonstrates a more intuitive way to manage a collection of books that have been managed manually. The web app includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books.

In this project, I have implemented and utilized a database for data persistence and leveraged helpful database-related tools to view and interact with it using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and SQL ORM Sequelize.
